# MAJOR-PROJECT
# Temperature/Humidity Sensing


# Aim:

To access the Temperature and Humidity values and then using the Serial Communication the temperature and humidity values are sent in a string message to the designed computer application using the DHT11 sensor.

The DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor features a temperature & humidity sensor complex with a calibrated digital signal output. By using the exclusive digital-signal-acquisition technique and temperature & humidity sensing technology, it ensures high reliability and excellent long-term stability. Pin number 1 is the VCC, pin number 2 is the data, pin number 3 is not connected while pin number 4 is the Ground.
 
Our job here is to develop the DHT11 using the Arduino UNO to access the Temperature and Humidity values and then using the Serial Communication the temperature and humidity values are sent in a string message to the designed computer application. These values are displayed on the screen and are also sent to the destination email id.
THE CODE FOR PROGRAMMING THE SENSOR HAS BEEN ATTACHED.


# Applications:
This sensor is used in various applications such as measuring humidity and temperature values in heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. Weather stations also use these sensors to predict weather conditions. The humidity sensor is used as a preventive measure in homes where people are affected by humidity. Offices, cars, museums, greenhouses and industries use this sensor for measuring humidity values and as a safety measure.


# Result:
The DHT 11 was developed using the Arduino UNO and it is programmed to send an email specifying the readings such as humidity and temperature which proves to be useful to the user
